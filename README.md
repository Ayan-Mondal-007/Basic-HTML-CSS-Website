# Basic-HTML-CSS-Website

Hello this is Ayan..ðŸ˜Š

I have created a very basic webpage using only HTML,CSS and very very little java script (2 to 3 line for a toggle btn) 

I hope if someones sees this they will like it :)..

also i like to say that something related to the website there are some fonts which are imported from Google fonts using urls 
  so I will hope that it won't give any error as there are other fonts (sans-serif) if they doesnt render.

Emm..I thinks thats it what i want to say ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š

  Tbh i don't know why i am saying all this for but thats . . thats it..

  Thank You. byeðŸ‘‹
